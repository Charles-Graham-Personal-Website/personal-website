            This is my homepage of my personal website.  This will be the 
            page to get your most up to date information on the journey 
            I have been on so far to become a fullstack developer.  The 
            journey has been a great one but will only provide more 
            challenges in the upcoming months.  Where we find ourselves
            today is building our first webpage that people can view to
            find out some of our qualifications, interests and some of our
            previous work under our portfolio.  Hopefully you will be 
            viewing this page soon because that will prove well for us all.

            This is an area that will hold all my skills and abilities
            for the tech community to see and help me get a job 
            in the industry that I have been trying to get into 
            for a while now.
