            My name is Charles Graham and I am a Web Developer.  I have been
        working in the industry for a short time just after I finished 
        my bootcamp.  I am currently working in my Web development bootcamp
        to become a much more knowledgeable coder in the tech world.  I have
        worked in construction for the past 10 years or so mostly operating
        heavy machinery.  My last job was working on a 200 ton crane in San Diego, CA.
