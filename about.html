                <p>My name is Charles Graham and I am a Web Developer.  I have been
        working in the industry for a short time just after I finished 
        my bootcamp.  I am currently working in my Web development bootcamp
        to become a much more knowledgeable coder in the tech world.  I have
        worked in construction for the past 10 years or so mostly operating
        heavy machinery.  My last job was working on a 200 ton crane in San Diego, CA.
        I have been wanting to change into a career in tech for a while and was
        convinced by my fiancee that it was about time I did so.
        <br><br>
        When i finally started making the move towards my goal to be
        a web developer, It was one of the anxiety riddled moves I had made
        considering I had been in a steady job for years but just was not 
        enjoying it as I once did.  The first few months were pretty tough 
        and I tried to learn a lot on my own through sites such as 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a> and 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">developer.mozilla.org</a>
        and these helped to try and get me where I was going but still
        didnt know all the basics and needed a little help here and there.

        <div class="holy-grail-sidebar-1 hg-sidebar">This is the about
            page that has not much to do yet with the page because there
            is not much to tell about yet.  but at some point this will be
            turned into a nav bar with hyperlinks to some of my portfolio 
            projects.  
        </div>

        <div class="holy-grail-sidebar-2 hg-sidebar">sidebar 2 for now will 
            stay somewhat the same until i figure out more of what i want to
            do with it.  I will probably add photos of some of the logos that 
            I have made projects for.
